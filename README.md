# A Cross-Source Data Repository for Energy Storage Planning
This data repository is thoughtfully designed to enhance accessibility, empowering researchers to conduct more efficient analyses and drive innovation in ESS optimization and grid economics.

## Features
The data repository for Energy Storage System (ESS) planning offers a comprehensive collection of datasets that support in-depth analysis of energy storage opportunities across Texas. The key features include:

### 1. Locational Marginal Prices (`LMPs`) for ERCOT Nodes
- **Data Coverage**: Historical LMP data for all ERCOT nodes, spanning from 2010 to 2022.
- **Resolution**: Prices are available at a 5-minute interval resolution, facilitating granular temporal analysis.
- **Data Structure**: Organized by node and year, each day is represented by a unique column with 5-minute intervals over 24 hours represented in 288 rows.
- **Access**: The data democratizes access to long-term ERCOT LMP data, which can be challenging to obtain.

### 2. Geographic Locations of ERCOT Nodes
- **Mapping**: Locational data of ERCOT nodes has been extracted and mapped onto a 600-by-600-pixel representation of Texas.
- **Visualization**: The map and conversion tools provided in this repository enable spatially accurate visualizations, such as those comparing locational marginal prices over time.

### 3. Locations of Renewable Energy and ESS Sites
- **Coverage**: Includes the geographic locations of solar farms, wind power facilities, and ESS installations across Texas.
- **Support for Spatial Analysis**: The coordinates provided for each installation allow for precise spatial analysis and mapping, aiding in identifying synergies in energy generation and storage.

## Navigation
This repository mainly contains three components: source data, released data, and plotting code. We navigate this data repository as follows:

All data sourced from the ERCOT Data Access Portal is archived in the `data_source/` folder. Although ERCOT generates one file every 5 minutes, we have organized these files by year to simplify analysis, consolidating them into a single file per year. Each yearly file is named in the format `lmp_<year>_nodes.csv`.

For filtered data, the `data_release/` folder contains individual files for each node, organized by year. Each file, named `<nodename>_<year>.csv`, provides 5-minute interval LMP values for the respective node.

## Usage
This repository is ideal for:
- **Temporal Analysis**: Examining LMP variability over time across different ERCOT nodes.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Understanding locational price differences and optimizing energy storage deployment.
- **Energy Storage Planning**: Supporting planning for ESS by providing detailed data on prices, locations, and renewable generation facilities.

## Acknowledgments
This repository integrates publicly available data from:
- **ERCOT**: Locational Marginal Price and node data.
- **Energy Information Administration (EIA)**: Locations of renewable energy and ESS installations.

## Support Team
This project is a collaboration of our group members under the supervision of Prof. Le Xie, Gordon McKay Professor of Electrical Engineering at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The support team keeps processing, correcting and updating the data every day. The team will also conduct further research analysis and share the latest progress in this repository.
